## Stakeholder Roles

*   **Talent**

    The ultimate goal of the talent is to land a job by acquiring new skills. To obtain new skills, talents would need to borrow NFT tokens representing a course. The talent will need to borrow from a sponsor who owns an NFT of the desired course and complete the entire course. After completing a course, the talents can be recruited by a company because of their new skill.
*   **Sponsor**

    The sponsorâ€™s role is to buy NFT and lend to talents in the hopes that the talent lands a promising career and the sponsor acquires fees from the recruitment process. The sponsor will purchase the NFT and has the choice of choosing which talent to lend the NFT. Once the talent has completed the course, the NFT is returned to the sponsor in a broken state, where the sponsor will need to pay a fee before lending it to another talent.
*   **Teachers**

    Teachers in the Ongaeshi project will be responsible for creating the courses that will then be created into an NFT. In this current stage, the course material will be stored in the database which students with the NFT will be able to access. Teachers will also get a share of the recruiting fee that will be sent to their wallet address.
*   **Corporate**

    The role of a corporation is to hire talents from a variety of pools in the Ongaeshi project. As the company knows that the talent has fully completed a course, they can rest assured that the talent has acquired the necessary skills. When the talent and the company have finalized their hiring process, the company will need to pay a certain amount as a fee to other stakeholders.
*   **Coach**

    There may be times when a course may be too hard or the talent may need extra help to complete a course. In this instance, a coach can be included in this process to help ensure that the talent is on track and completes the course. As the coach can be hired for various reasons, the role of the coach can vary. However, after the talent has been hired, the coach will also receive part of the fee.
* **Admin**\
  As the Ongaeshi project is not fully decentralized, many aspects like NFT updating and minting NFT must be done through the admin side. As such IGS will have various APIs created for this reason to help maintain the Ongaeshi project.
