The Ongaeshi project is currently using a database in its project to hold various data that are not held in the NFT. This database works in conjunction with the front-end user application to allow users to view these data according to their role in the project. For example, companies may be able to view talents' resume and their progress in the course to see if they are a potential fit for the company. Sponsors and talents may also be able to see the course progress.

IGS admins are using APIs for many of their administrative tasks like minting, creating NFT, updating the data, and creating talent matching. These APIs are called through the system wallet and work the database.\
