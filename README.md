# Ongaeshi Mission

ONGAESHI's mission is to eradicate the financial barriers that prevent individuals from accessing education, directly confronting the inequality that exists in our current system. We envision a world where the cycle of giving and receiving—embodied in our name, "ONGAESHI"—creates a sustainable ecosystem of education and opportunity. By leveraging Web 3.0 technology, we aim to not only democratize access to education but also to foster a system where the benefits of learning and growth are shared, promoting a cycle of support and empowerment. We are committed to building a decentralized ecosystem through ONGAESHI DAO, where everyone, regardless of their financial situation, can pursue their educational and career aspirations. Our initiative is to make education a powerful equalizer in society, enabling individuals to achieve happiness, contribute to a diverse and peaceful society, and support others in turn. Our pledge is to transform the concept of capitalism into a more inclusive and equitable model, where the cycle of "ONGAESHI" ensures that no one is left behind due to financial constraints. This is the essence of ONGAESHI's mission: to create a world where education is accessible to all, fostering a community that thrives on mutual support and shared success
