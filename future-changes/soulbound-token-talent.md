# SoulBound Token Talent

The second soul-bound token (_Soulbound Token type to be discussed further_) that will be introduced is for the talent profile. Each talent will be assigned a soul-bound token when they start a course after the sponsor agreed to lend the NFT to the student. This soul-bound token will track including but is not limited to:

* Number of completed courses
* Progress of the current course taken in ONGAESHI platform
* Number of failed courses

This soul-bound token can be used by sponsor to evaluate how qualified an individual is when the sponsor would like to accept or reject a lend request.&#x20;
