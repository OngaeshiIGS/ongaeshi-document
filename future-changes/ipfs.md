# IPFS?

As shown in the infrastructure diagram, the Ongaeshi project heavily relies on the database and APIs from Ongaeshi Admins for many of its day-to-day operations making it very centralized. However, in the future, we are planning to use IPFS for data storage and move away from APIs being called by Ongaeshi Admin. We would like to eliminate or partially implement a database and use more decentralized data management systems. We would like to implement IPFS system to store data like images of the NFT or metadata of NFTs.
