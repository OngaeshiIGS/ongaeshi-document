# OpenSea Market

OpenSea is the largest market for NFT to be listed and sold. Ongaeshi would like the NFT that contains the course material created by the teacher to be directly sold in OpenSea. The current state requires the sponsor to buy from IGS using fiat or stablecoin, which makes the entire process of buying and selling NFT very centralized.

### Primary Market&#x20;

OpenSea market will be the platform for all the newly NFTs for sponsors to purchase. In this process, the teacher will create the course and works with ONGAESHI team to create the NFT collection associated with the course in OpenSea. Once the NFT collection is ready to be mint in the platform, a sponsor can purchase from OpenSea which will send some fees to ONGAESHI team. Then the sponsor go to ONGAESHI platform to lend the NFT to any of the talents afterwards.

### Secondary Market

The ONGAESHI NFT owner who would like to sell their used ONGAESHI NFT token can do so in OpenSea as secondary marketplace. The reason a secondary marketplace may exist is for sponsors to be able to buy NFT courses that may not be available for purchase. However, these NFT purchased on the secondary market may need to be repaired which may put more cost on the sponsor who has newly bought the NFT but the ONGAESHI status of the NFT recorded during the activities will be remained in the NFT. Therefore, sponsor who bought from secondary market can fast track their status in ONGAESHI platform. In the process, once a sponsor buys an NFT from the secondary market, the sponsor will need to go to the Ongaeshi website to repair the token in order to lend it to a talent.
