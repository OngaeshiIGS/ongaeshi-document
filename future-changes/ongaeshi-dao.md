# Ongaeshi DAO

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is a structure that runs based on no central authority. User will be able to use their own tokens to vote on changes and make decisions. To implement DAO into Ongaeshi, Ongaeshi will need to create a DAO token called ONGS. This token will be used to vote on project proposals and changes in the future.&#x20;
