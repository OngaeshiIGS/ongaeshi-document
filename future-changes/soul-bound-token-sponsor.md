# Soul Bound Token Sponsor

There will be new Soulbound Token Badge ERC-5114 tokens being introduced to the Ongaeshi project. (_Soulbound Token type to be discussed further_)

The first soul-bound token's main role is to keep a profile of the sponsor. Once a sponsor buys an NFT course to sponsor a talent, the sponsor can claim a soul-bound token in ONGAESHI platform. In the soul-bound token, the data that will be kept for the user includes but is not limited:

* Amount of successful sponsorship
* Number of courses bought (Identified by the NFT course token owned in the wallet)
* Total amount of activation fees paid (Recorded the primary market price purchased from Opensea)&#x20;
* Tracks total returns from talent matching&#x20;

In ONGAESHI, we would like to build more incentives for sponsors to sponsor more talent on top of the distribution of fees when the talent is recruited. As such there will be a reward system with different tiers for the sponsor to be able to get benefits for their contribution. The data stored on the soul-bound token will determine what tier the sponsor is within the reward system. These rewards like airdrops will be completed through a smart contract called reward distributor.
